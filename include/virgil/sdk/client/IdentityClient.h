         * Virgil Identity Service is responsible for validation of user's identities,
         * like email, application, etc. Typical workflow for an email confirmation contains the following steps:
         *   - The process is initiated by invocation of the verify() method
         *   - Identity service generates a confirmation code and sends it to the specified email
         *   - Confirm email by invoke method @link confirm() @endlink with
         *         the confirmation code sent to the email and identity id from the previous step
         *   - Identity service returns the token within class @link virgil::sdk::model::ValidatedIdentity @endlink,
         *         that can be used to prove that the user is the identity holder
         *   - To verify that the user is identity holder invoke the @link isValid() @endlink method
         *         with the token from the previous step
